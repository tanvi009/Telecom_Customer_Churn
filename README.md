#Telecom Customer Churn

Customer Churn is a burning problem for Telecom companies. It is especially important in mature industries where the initial period of exponential growth has been left behind. Not surprisingly, attrition (or, to look on the bright side, retention) is a major application of data mining. In this project, we simulate one such case of customer churn where we work on a data of post-paid customers with a contract. The data has information about customer usage behaviour, contract details, and payment details. The data also indicates which were the customers who can/called their service. Based on this past data, we need to build a model that can predict whether a customer will cancel their service in the future or not.
